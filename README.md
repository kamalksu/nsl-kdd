## Dataset NSL-KDD (modified KDD’99)
• The KDD cup was an International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition.

• From this competition, a mass amount of internet traffic records were collected and bundled into a data set called the KDD’99

• NSL-KDD, is a cleaned-up version of the KDD’99 from the University of New Brunswick, Canada

## NSL-KDD (Different type of network attacks)
• Denial of Service (DoS) : abnormal traffic to IDS and system shut down.

• Probe: Steal information but do not break.

• User to Root(U2R) : Start with normal user and get root access.
