# ML and Cybersecurity Analytics in HPCC System Platform
Information security in the era of AI and automation is the biggest challenge for cybersecurity professionals. Traditional information security protection has limitations in detecting zero-day attacks, which is overcome with the AI based information security. Combining traditional and machine learning algorithms enhances the improvement of threat detection. When implementing Machine learning in security protection, an organization needs to consider the design, deployment, and maintenance of the system which has to be powerful, secured,  and cost-effective. HPCC Systems Platform from LexisNexis Risk Solutions is one of the finest platforms for maintaining data-lake and its parallel computing power helps in faster processing of machine learning model training. This presenation will demonstrate how an open-source platform can be used for information security by leveraging various machine-learning algorithms.

## Cybersecurity and Intrusion detection system

• An intrusiondetectionsystem (IDS) is anapplication/multiple applicationswithhardware devices, thatmonitors networktraffic andsearchesforknownthreatsandsuspiciousor maliciousactivity.

• Intrusion is an unwanted or unauthorized attempt to gain access to computer, that can be any computerized device, that includes workstation or a server, a firewall or an IDS itself.


## Dataset NSL-KDD (modified KDD’99)
• The KDD cup was an International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition.

• From this competition, a mass amount of internet traffic records were collected and bundled into a data set called the KDD’99

• NSL-KDD, is a cleaned-up version of the KDD’99 from the University of New Brunswick, Canada

## NSL-KDD (Different type of network attacks)
• Denial of Service (DoS) : abnormal traffic to IDS and system shut down.

• Probe: Steal information but do not break.

• User to Root(U2R) : Start with normal user and get root access.

• and Remote to Local (R2L): Gain local access to remote machine.

## Conclusion
Each Machine Learning algorithm has its own quirks — assumptions and constraints — that need to be taken into account in order to maximize the predictive accuracy. Furthermore, quantifying the efficacy of the predictions requires skills in data-science and statistics. For these reasons, it is very important that we do not use our exploration of ML to produce products or make claims on abilities without first consulting experts in the field.
